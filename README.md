# application-templates

Templates for creating new Elvia applications.

**Intended to be used with the [Elvia CLI](https://github.com/3lvia/cli).**

## Types of applications

### Web APIs

Applications that expose some sort of API, typically used for serving data to clients.

### Workers

Applications that run in the background and perform tasks.

## Notes

**[dotnet](dotnet) is equivalent to [dotnet8-webapi](dotnet8-webapi).**
The former will be removed in the future, and is only here for backwards compatibility with the Elvia CLI.
